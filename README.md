# Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA): Algorithmic Frameworks

This repository presents the **mathematical formulation and algorithmic structure**
of two canonical Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) models widely used in
efficiency and benchmarking studies:

- Half-Normal Stochastic Frontier
- Truncated-Normal Stochastic Frontier

The focus is on **theory, likelihood construction, and estimation logic** rather
than executable code.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to demonstrate:
- Deep understanding of stochastic frontier theory
- Ability to translate econometric models into estimation algorithms
- Awareness of identification, numerical stability, and efficiency interpretation

It is designed for **quantitative, data science, and econometrics roles**, particularly
in energy, utilities, productivity, and operational efficiency domains.

## Scope
Included:
- Model equations and assumptions
- Likelihood derivations (conceptual)
- Estimation algorithms in pseudo-code
- Interpretation of technical efficiency

Excluded:
- Production implementations
- Employer-specific pipelines
- Proprietary datasets or calibration logic


## Disclaimer
⚠️ **Intellectual Property Notice**

This repository contains **theoretical descriptions and algorithmic outlines only**.
No production code, proprietary implementations, or employer-related intellectual
property is included. All material is derived from publicly available academic theory
and the author's independent understanding of stochastic frontier analysis.
